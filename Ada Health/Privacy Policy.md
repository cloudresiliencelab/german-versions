**Ada's service**

Ada offers its symptom assessment and other health related features in its Ada Health App (the “App”), on its own website or embedded in a partner platform (“Ada Assess”). The App as well as Ada Assess are registered as Class IIa medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (“MDR”) within the European Union. However, the App and/or Ada Assess might not be regulated as medical devices in the place where you use it. In addition, Ada operates the website ada.com (except for users in the US where the website is provided by our US subsidiary Ada Health, Inc.) and any additional features it might include (the “Website”).

This Privacy Policy describes our data processing when using the App, Ada Assess, the Website or any service and/or product we may provide you (together with the “**Services**”). Where certain processing activities relate only to a specific product this will be clearly indicated.

You are not under any obligation to provide your personal information to Ada. Please note however, that most functionalities rely on information about yourself and specifically your health. Without providing this information you might not be able to use those functionalities at all or to a limited extent. In some cases, the accuracy of the results might be impacted. This will be indicated in the description of the individual processing activities in Section 3 below.

Using our Services on behalf of a third party is only permitted, where you are legally competent to give or authorise consent on behalf of that person. All other third parties should use Ada’s services directly for themselves. For the avoidance of any doubt, any reference in this Privacy Policy to “your data” shall include data about other individuals that you have provided us with.

**Automated decision-making**

When using Ada’s Services, you are not subject to a decision that is based solely on automated processing which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you (automated decision-making, Art. 22 GDPR). While your symptom assessment report is the result of automated processing, it is only intended for your information and does not have any consequences for any treatment you might receive. You can freely choose to share your assessment report with your health care practitioner, but any treatment decisions will be theirs, not those of Ada.

Please note that if you use Ada Assess through Ada’s business partners they may make automated decisions based on the outcome of the symptom assessment. Ada's business partners are solely responsible for such decisions. Any rights under Art. 22 GDPR must be asserted against them.

With these analyses we help identify infectious disease outbreaks and monitor their timely and geographic developments (e.g., during COVID-19 pandemic). As our data is also including people who have not consulted yet the health care system, we can better estimate the true burden of diseases. We may share and present the results as summarized statistics to our partners, e.g., in the public health and scientific community, always on an irreversibly anonymized basis. We may also process such types of data to provide you with the best guidance possible by, for example, directing you to the most appropriate care facility and help reduce unnecessary burden for you, but also for health care systems.

4\. Cookies and tracking on our Website
---------------------------------------

Our Website uses so-called “cookies”. Cookies are text files that are stored in the Internet browser or by the Internet browser on your device (computer, tablet, or phone). We use the term “cookies” to refer to all tools that collect data on our Website (e.g., IP addresses, place and time of the visit) including pixels. Your data collected in this way is pseudonymized and is not stored together with your other personal data. This processing is carried out either on the legal basis of performance of the usage contract for our website for necessary cookies or your consent for voluntary analytics or marketing cookies.

For detailed information on the cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them and to manage your Cookie preferences, see our [Cookie Policy](https://ada.com/cookie-policy/).

Ada also measures the success of its marketing campaign with cookie-less measures. To do this, Ada relies on information your browser automatically shares when you click on one of our ads and are directed to our Services. This way, we count how often a certain ad is clicked to determine which of our campaigns is most effective. Data is only processed in aggregated form. Ada is not able to identify you based on the information collected this way. Your data is not shared with third parties.

5\. Where do we store your personal data
----------------------------------------

The personal data that we collect from you is stored in the European Union on Cloud Servers of Amazon Web Services EMEA S.A.R.L. (“AWS”) with a business seat in Luxembourg and on the Cloud Servers of Google Commerce Limited ("GCL"), a company incorporated under the laws of Ireland, with its offices at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Limited data may, however, be processed by sub- processors operating outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) based on a data processing agreement, as long as the additional requirements of Article 44 et seq. GDPR for the processing of personal data in third countries are met (see below). Your health data and other sensitive data will always stay in the EU.

Sensitive information between your browser and our Website is transferred in encrypted form using Transport Layer Security (“**TLS**”). When transmitting sensitive information, you should always make sure that your browser can validate our certificate.

Please contact us if you would like further details on the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal data outside the EEA.

6\. Disclosure of your personal data and email security
-------------------------------------------------------

Ada shares your personal data with third parties to provide you with its services or as required in the course of its business. Ada does not share your data for third-party commercial interests without your explicit consent.

Your personal data will be disclosed as follows:

*   **Service providers** We use technical service providers to operate and maintain our Services, who act as our processors based on data processing agreements as required by Art. 28 GDPR. This includes sharing of your data with other Ada entities. A full list of our third-party processors processing your personal data on our behalf and strictly according to section 3 above can be found [here](https://ada.com/service-providers/). Where we use Service providers who process personal data on our behalf outside the EEA (or “**third countries**”) we do so with the appropriate safeguards for your data subject rights.  
    Most of our US service providers are certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. Where this is not the case, we have agreed on the Standard Contractual Clauses with added securities (where necessary).  
    More details on third country service providers and the measures taken to ensure your rights are detailed in the relevant sub-sections of section 3 above.
    
*   **Buyers of Ada’s company or business assets** If we sell any company or business or assets, your personal data might be one of the transferred assets and we may disclose or transfer your personal data to the buyer of such business or assets in accordance with applicable law.
    
*   **Affiliate partners** We might engage in affiliate programs. In that case, we may share the information with those affiliate program partners that you were directed to their services by us. This is done for billing purposes. We do not share any Personal Information which can directly identify you. However, when you register for the services of our affiliate program partners you may be asked to provide Personal Information that allows them to identify you (for example the information you share for booking an appointment through our affiliate program partners’ platforms etc.)
    

**Security Notice Regarding Communication by Email**

Ada wants to inform you that data transmission via email can have security vulnerabilities. Our email communication is only protected by transport-level encryption (e.g., using the TLS protocol). This means that the data is protected from being viewed by third parties while in transit between your device and our email server, and vice versa.

However, the data is potentially accessible in plain text on the servers of the email providers involved (both yours and ours). There is no end-to-end encryption in place, which would ensure that the content can only be read by the sender and the intended recipient.

For this reason, communication by unencrypted email carries the risk that:

*   Unauthorized third parties could gain access to the content of your messages (e.g., through an attack on a provider's servers).
    
*   The providers themselves or their administrators would technically be able to access the content.
    

This risk is particularly relevant when transmitting special categories of personal data such as health data. This type of data is subject to an especially high level of protection.

Before we send you any health data via email we ask for your explicit consent and acknowledgement of these risks. If you contact us by email and, on your own initiative, send us sensitive information, particularly health data, via this channel, we will assume that you consent to communicating via this method and accept the associated risks described above.

Ada’s services do not require to share sensitive information via email. Where we offer such a feature, it is purely for your convenience and other secure options are also available.

7\. How long do we retain your personal data
--------------------------------------------

We will hold your personal data for as long as it is necessary or required by law or by any relevant regulatory body, and always in compliance with the data minimization principle. Specific storage periods for the respective processing activities are detailed in section 3 above.

If your personal data is used for more than one purpose, we will retain it until the purpose with the longest period expires, but we will stop using it for the purpose with the shorter period as soon as the shorter period expires (to comply with the purpose limitation principle). We restrict access to your personal data to the persons who need to use it for the relevant purpose(s), always in compliance with the integrity and confidentiality principle.

After the processing of your data is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined in section 3 or your account is deleted (see section 3.2) we will securely and separately store some of your data in accordance with statutory retention obligations applicable to us and reasonable business needs.

We will retain Post-Market-Surveillance data (incl. health data) in accordance with our storage obligations according to the medical device law.

We will retain data (incl. health data) in relation to your use of our Services for up to seven years in accordance with our business needs for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending against legal claims.

If you were a user of the UK Doctor Chat services (which is no longer available since 23 March 2018), your consultation details may be retained by us for a period up to 10 years according to the UK Records Management Code of Practice Retention Schedule, or if otherwise required by Care Quality Commission (“**CQC**”).

If the processing of your personal data is no longer necessary for any purpose it is either irreversibly anonymized (and the anonymized data may be retained), or securely erased.

*   **Right to restriction of processing**: As a data subject, you have a right to restriction of processing under the conditions provided in Article 18 GDPR. This means that you have the right to obtain from us the restriction of processing if one of the conditions provided in Article 18(1) GDPR applies.

Restriction means that stored personal data are marked with the goal of restricting their future processing (Article 4(3) GDPR).

Where you exercise both your GDPR and your MHMDA rights simultaneously, Ada will guarantee those rights in addition to each other.

You may have the following rights under the MHMDA:
