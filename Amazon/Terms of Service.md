6 YOUR ACCOUNT

If there is a problem charging your selected payment method, we may charge any other valid payment method associated with your account. Click [Your Payments](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/cpe/managepaymentmethods) to manage your payment options.

If you use any Amazon Service you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer and your mobile devices, and to the extent permitted by applicable law you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You should take all necessary steps to ensure that the password is kept confidential and secure and should inform us immediately if you have any reason to believe that your password has become known to anyone else, or if the password is being, or is likely to be used in an unauthorised manner.

7 REVIEWS, COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER CONTENT
-----------------------------------------------------

Visitors may post reviews, comments and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions or other information, as long as the content is not illegal, obscene, abusive, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, constitute a communicative attack against children/adolescents, impair the personal integrity of children/adolescents, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings or any form of "spam". You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. We reserve the right (but not, in the absence of a valid [Notice Form](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GPB6E9Q3G6EXLEJN), the obligation) to remove or edit such content. If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed by an item or information on any Amazon Service, please notify us by completing and submitting the appropriate [Notice Form](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202024830) and we will respond.

If you post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant: (a) Amazon a non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable and transferable rights to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media; and (b) Amazon, its sublicensees and transferees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such content, if they choose. No moral rights are assigned under this provision.

You agree that the rights you grant above are irrevocable during the entire period of protection of your intellectual property rights associated with such content and material. To the extent permitted by law, you agree to waive your right to be identified as the author of such content and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such content. You agree to perform all further acts necessary to perfect any of the above rights granted by you to Amazon including the execution of deeds and documents, at our request.

You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that, as at the date that the content or material is posted: (i) the content and material is accurate; and (ii) use of the content and material you supply does not breach any applicable policies or guidelines of Amazon and will not cause injury to any person or entity (including that the content or material is not defamatory and does not impair the personal integrity of children/adolescents). You agree to indemnify Amazon for all claims brought by a third party against Amazon arising out of or in connection with the content and material you supply except to the extent that any liability arises from our failure to properly remove the content when it is notified of the illegal nature of the content ([Notice Form](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GPB6E9Q3G6EXLEJN)) arising out of or on the grounds of, or originating from the content that you have communicated to us.

8 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS
------------------------------

Amazon respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been used in a way that gives rise to concerns of infringement, please follow our [Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Right Infringements](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/report/infringement).

9 AMAZON SOFTWARE TERMS
-----------------------

In addition to these Conditions of Use, the terms found on the help page [Amazon Games and Software Terms of Use](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201441190) apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from time to time for your use in connection with Amazon Services (the "Amazon Software").

10 OTHER BUSINESS
-----------------

Parties other than Amazon operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines on this website. In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals or the content of their websites. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in these Conditions of Use, the below Conditions of Sale or the Service Terms, Amazon does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all of these or any other third parties. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we may share your information related to those transactions with that third party. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.

11 THIRD PARTY SELLERS AND AMAZON'S ROLE
----------------------------------------

Amazon allows third party sellers to list and sell their products at Amazon.de. In each such case this is indicated on the respective product detail page. While Amazon helps facilitate transactions that are carried out on the Amazon Marketplace, Amazon is neither the buyer nor the seller of the seller's items. Amazon provides a venue for sellers and buyers to negotiate and complete transactions. Accordingly, the contract formed at the completion of a sale for these third party products is solely between buyer and seller. Amazon is not a party to this contract nor assumes any liability arising out of or in connection with it nor is it the seller's agent. Except stated below in this section, the third party seller is responsible for the sale of the products and for dealing with any buyer claims or any other issue arising out of or in connection with the contract between the buyer and seller. Because Amazon wants the buyer to have a safer buying experience, Amazon provides the [Amazon A-to-z guarantee](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G59PXSUWUFR92NUQ) in addition to any contractual or other rights.

Please note that some third party sellers may be selling as private individuals and not as professional traders. In each case this information is indicated on the Detailed Seller Information page (which you can access by clicking on the seller’s name) and is based on information provided by the seller to Amazon. If a seller is not a business, please note that your normal statutory rights under consumer protection laws (for example, 2-year or 3 years warranty rights, depending on the country, and the right to cancel your order without giving any reason within 14 days) will not apply. However, the Amazon A-to-z guarantee and our voluntary 30-day returns guarantee will still apply in this case.

If the third party seller’s items are indicated as Fulfilled by Amazon, Amazon will manage the delivery and our customer service will handle any issue related to the order. For more information, specifically on how to resolve disputes in these particular cases, see the help page [Fulfilled by Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G239KSGYPUFUY8TQ).

If the third party seller’s items are not indicated as Fulfilled by Amazon the seller will manage the delivery of your order. For more information see the help page [Ordering from a Marketplace Seller](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GEF528GN65XSJ7V8). The seller will also handle any customer services inquiries, except if it is indicated that customer service is provided by Amazon or if your order is marked with the Amazon Prime badge.

12 OUR LIABILITY
----------------

We will do our utmost to ensure that availability of the Amazon Services will be uninterrupted and that transmissions will be error-free. However, due to the nature of the internet, this cannot be guaranteed. Also, your access to Amazon Services may also be occasionally suspended or restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance, or the introduction of new facilities or services. We will attempt to limit the frequency and duration of any such suspension or restriction.

Amazon is liable without limitation if damage is caused by an intentional or gross negligent breach of duty by Amazon or one of its legal representatives or vicarious agents.

In addition, Amazon is liable for slight negligent breach of essential obligations. Essential are those obligations the breach of which puts at risk the achievement of the contractual purpose, or the performance of which enables the fulfillment of the contract and is regularly trusted on by you. In this case, Amazon however is only liable for foreseeable damage typical of the contract. Amazon is not liable for slight negligent breach of any other obligations than those mentioned in the previous sentences.

The aforementioned limitations of liability do not apply for damages from injury to life, body or health, for a defect after a guarantee for the condition of the product of for fraudulently concealed defects. The liability under the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected.

To the extent the liability of Amazon is excluded or limited, such exclusion or limitation also applies to the employees, legal representatives or vicarious agents of Amazon.

13 APPLICABLE LAW
-----------------

These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the district of Luxembourg City, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Conditions of Use in Luxembourg or in the EU country in which you live. We prefer to solve your requests in direct contact with you and therefore do not participate in alternative consumer dispute resolution proceedings. If you would like to bring a matter to our attention, please [contact us](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/kontakt).

14 EXPORT CONTROLS
------------------

You agree that you will not export, re-export, or transfer any products (including software or other digital products) that you have purchased on the website to any country, individual, corporation, organization, or entity to which such export is restricted or prohibited by law. For example, economic sanctions and embargoes imposed by the European Union, the United Nations, US Departments of State, Treasury or Commerce, and other government authorities (such as embargoes imposed on specific countries, or economic sanctions imposed on individuals or companies for terrorism or money laundering offences) may prohibit you from taking products to other countries, even for your own personal use, and/or sending products (whether physically by mail or digitally via email or file-sharing) to particular individuals, corporations, organizations or entities. In addition, you agree that you will not purchase any product or service from the website if you are subject to restrictive measures (sanctions).

15 ALTERATIONS TO SERVICE OR AMENDMENTS TO THE CONDITIONS OF USE
----------------------------------------------------------------

You will be subject to the Amazon Services, policies, terms and conditions including these Conditions of Use, and Service Terms in force at the time that you use the Amazon Services. If you should have an Amazon account, and provided that such change does not constitute an unfair disadvantage for you, we may change the policies, terms and conditions including these Conditions of Use and Service Terms, or any part of it, at any time for the following reasons: for legal or regulatory reasons; for security reasons; to enhance existing features or add additional features to our Services; to reflect advancements in technology; to make reasonable technical adjustments to our Services; and to ensure the ongoing operability of our Service. If we make changes, we will inform you in due time and remind you of your rights. You will keep the possibility to cancel your Amazon account at any time. If any change is found invalid or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions. Notwithstanding, we reserve the right to make changes to any Amazon Services at any time.”

16 WAIVER
---------

If you breach these Conditions of Use and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Use.

17 CHILDREN
-----------

We do not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18 you may use the Amazon Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

18 GOVERNING LANGUAGE

Conditions of Sale
------------------

1 SCOPE OF APPLICABILITY
------------------------

These Conditions of Sale govern the sale of products by Amazon EU SARL to you.

We offer a wide range of Amazon Services, and sometimes additional terms may apply. When you use an Amazon Service (for example Your Account, Gift Cards, Amazon applications for mobile or Message Center), you will also be subject to the terms, guidelines and conditions applicable to that Amazon Service ("Service Terms"). If these Conditions of Sale are inconsistent with the Service Terms, those Service Terms will control.

Please read these conditions carefully before placing an order with Amazon EU SARL. By placing an order with Amazon EU SARL, you signify your agreement to be bound by these conditions.

2 OUR CONTRACT
--------------

Your order is an offer to Amazon to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place an order to purchase a product from Amazon, we will send you a message confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "Order Confirmation"). If you are using certain Amazon Services (e.g. Amazon mobile applications) the Order Confirmation may be posted on a Message Center on the website. The Order Confirmation is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) or the services ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e-mail or post a message on the Message Center of the website confirming to you that we've dispatched the product to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation"). If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between us for the product(s) specified in that Dispatch Confirmation. Your contract is with Amazon EU Sarl. Without affecting your right of cancellation set out in section 3 below, you can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation relating to that product.

This right to cancel does not apply to certain categories of products and services, including digital products or software which are not supplied in a physical format (e.g. on a CD or DVD), once download or use (whichever is earlier) has begun.

You consent to receive sales invoices electronically in a format and method of delivery as determined by us, e.g. made available in pdf format in the [Your Account area of the web site](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/meinkonto). For each delivery, we will inform you in our Dispatch Confirmation if an electronic invoice is available. For further information about electronic invoices and instructions on how to receive a paper copy please refer to our help pages.

Please note that we sell products only in quantities which correspond to the typical needs of an average household. This applies both to the number of products ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household.

3 RIGHT OF CANCELLATION UP TO 14 DAYS, EXCEPTIONS TO CANCELLATION AND OUR VOLUNTARY RETURNS GUARANTEE, STATUTORY WARRANTY RIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**INSTRUCTION ON RIGHT TO CANCELLATION**

**STATUTORY RIGHT**

You have the right to cancel your order without giving any reason within 14 days from the day on which you or a third party indicated by you (other than the carrier) receives the goods purchased (or last good, lot or piece if the order relates to goods or multiple lots or pieces delivered separately) or from the day of the conclusion of the contract, in the case of services or digital content not supplied in a tangible medium (e.g. CD or DVD).

You must inform us (Amazon EU Sarl, 38 avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg) of your decision to cancel your order. You may submit your request according to the instructions and forms available on our [Returns Support Center](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/returns), by [contacting us](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/kontakt) or using [this standard cancellation form](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/cancellationform) . In case you use the return center, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such cancellation without undue delay (e.g. by e-mail).

To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication on the exercise of the right to cancellation before the cancellation period has expired and return the goods via our Return Support Center within the deadline defined below.

For additional information on the scope, content and instructions for the exercise, please contact our Customer Service.

EFFECTS OF CANCELLATION
-----------------------

If you cancel your order, we will reimburse all payments received from you for the goods purchased (unless we are entitled to reduce your refund, as explained below) and will also reimburse delivery charges for the least expensive type of delivery offered by us. This reimbursement will be made without undue delay and, except in the situations described below, by no later than 14 days from the day on which we received your communication on the cancellation of this order. For such reimbursement we will use the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise. In any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement. We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest.

Note that you must send back the goods without undue delay and in any case by no later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate to us your cancellation of this order via our [Returns Support Center](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/returns). To meet the deadline, it is sufficient for you to send the goods before the period of 14 days has expired. Costs for returning the goods are specified in the [Return Costs](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GXM7UWCH63ZJHAVP) page. Goods not suitable for parcel shipment will be collected from you at your cost. Information about collection costs is available [here](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=G88WA5LB73F8UAUM).

You will only have to pay compensation for any deterioration of the goods if the value of the goods diminishes due to your handling of the goods (except when it was necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the goods). In this case, we may reduce your refund to reflect the diminished value of the goods. If the goods are significantly damaged as a result of your handling of them, you may not be entitled to a refund for them.

**EXCEPTIONS TO THE RIGHT OF CANCELLATION**

The right to cancellation does not exist or lapses, as the case may be, in the case of contracts regarding:

*   the delivery of goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygienic reasons if unsealed by you after delivery, or which, due to their nature, are, after delivery, inseparately mixed with other items;
*   the delivery of sealed audio or video recordings or of sealed software if unsealed by you after delivery;
*   the supply of goods made to customer specifications or clearly customized to personal needs;
*   the supply of goods which may deteriorate or expire rapidly;
*   a service if Amazon has fully performed it (e.g. the use of the Amazon MP3 Music Service) and you acknowledged and expressly accepted before you placed your order that we could start to deliver the service, and that you could not cancel it once the contract had been fully performed;
*   the supply of digital content (including apps, digital software, ebooks, MP3, etc.) which is not supplied on a tangible medium (e.g. on a CD or DVD) if you expressly accepted before your order has been executed and at the same time confirmed that we could start to deliver the content, and that you could not cancel it once delivery had started;
*   the delivery of newspapers, journals or magazines with the exception of subscription contracts; and
*   the supply of alcoholic beverages whose price has been agreed upon conclusion of the sales contract, which however can only be delivered after 30 days and whose actual value is dependent on fluctuations in the market which we cannot control.

**OUR VOLUNTARY RETURNS GUARANTEE**

In addition to your statutory rights, Amazon provides you with the following voluntary returns guarantee:

Products sold by Amazon EU SARL can be returned within 30 days of receipt of the products to Amazon EU SARL if none of the [exceptions](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7) applies, and if the products are complete and are in the same condition as upon receiving. Additional information can be found on our help page [About Our Returns Policies](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7). The products are to be returned via our [Returns Support Center](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/returns).

This voluntary returns guarantee does not apply to digital products or software which are not supplied on a tangible medium (e.g. on a CD or DVD).

You must return each product in the same condition in which you received it. You may be liable if the value of any returned product has been diminished due to your handling of it (except when such handling was necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the product). Therefore, if you do not return products in the same condition in which you received them in, Amazon reserves the right to reject the return or deduct a portion of the original purchase price from your refund to cover the diminished value.

If you return products according to this voluntary returns guarantee, we will refund to you the purchase price already paid by you (or a partial refund if you do not return a product in the same condition in which you received it), but not the delivery costs of your initial purchase. Likewise the transport risk and return costs are borne by you, unless the product is eligible for [free returns](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GJQG34CHB5RBDHZ9). The costs of return are refunded for returns of clothing or shoes purchased on the Amazon Stores and falling under the [Free Return on Fashion Items](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKUY8GVEZ5DZ89QR) policy. **This returns guarantee does not affect your statutory rights and therefore does not affect your right of cancellation as described above.**

Details on returning and examples can be found on our help page about [Return Items You Ordered](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G6E3B2E8QPHQ88KF).

STATUTORY WARRANTY RIGHTS:

In addition to your 30-day returns guarantee, customers in the European Union have statutory warranty rights for a period of two years from the delivery of the goods and can request repair or replacement of the goods purchased at Amazon if these goods have defects or are not as described. If the goods cannot be repaired or replaced within a reasonable time or cannot be repaired or replaced without difficulties you can claim reimbursement or a reduction of the purchase price.

In the case of used goods, the warranty period can be shorter than two years.

For further information on the terms and conditions please see our return conditions.

Further information on your statutory warranty rights can be found on the following help page: [Warranty under Statutory Consumer Rights](https://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201310960)

4 PRICING
---------

All prices are inclusive of legally applicable VAT.

Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalogue may be mispriced. We will verify pricing when processing your order and before we take payment. If we have made a mistake and a product's correct price is higher than the price on the website, we may either contact you before dispatch to request whether you want to buy the product at the correct price or cancel your order. If a product's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and send you the product.

5 PAYMENT, RETENTION OF TITLE, DIRECT DEBIT, PURCHASE ON ACCOUNT
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can pay the purchase price by payment on account (under the conditions set forth in this section 5), credit card or direct debit.

Every good delivered remains property of Amazon EU SARL until payment has been fully made.

**Payment by direct debit:**

In case of a direct debit return imputable to the customer, Amazon EU S.à r.l. will charge a lump sum damage of 3 EUR (direct debit return fee). The customer is entitled to prove that a damage has not occurred at all or is substantially lower than the lump sum claim.

The foregoing rules also apply to direct debits for the purpose of paying purchases made via 3rd party sellers (see Sec. 11 and 12 of the Terms of Use).

**Payment on account:**

If you are a new customer there is a maximum amount up to which a purchase on account is possible. This maximum amount applies to your entire account and takes into consideration outstanding payment from earlier orders on account.

Payment on account is only available to consumers of at least 18 years of age. The delivery address, the home address and the billing address must be identical and within Germany or Austria. Payment on account is not available for services or products delivered online (e.g. software downloads) or the purchase of vouchers. The payment amount becomes due upon receipt of the invoice. Amazon EU SARL reserves the right to not offer certain payment methods in individual cases.

In the case of payment on account we charge a one-time fee of EUR 1.50 inclusive of applicable VAT per delivery in addition to any applicable shipping costs. You will be separately informed before placing your order if this fee is charged.

Should the payment on account – for reasons imputable to the customer – not be paid on the due date, Amazon EU S.à r.l. will charge a lump sum damage of 3 EUR. The customer is entitled to prove that a damage has not occurred at all or is substantially lower than the lump sum claim.

In the case of payment on account and in other cases for legitimate reasons Amazon EU SARL will check and assess the data provided by you and exchange data with other company within the Amazon group and with credit agencies. For our decision on whether you can pay by payment on account we, in addition to our own data, use probabilities which we obtain from Bürgel Wirtschaftsinformationen GmbH & Co. KG, Gasstraße 18, 22761 Hamburg, Germany and informa Solutions GmbH, Rheinstraße 99, 76532 Baden Baden, Germany to assess the default risk. The calculations of such probabilities are based on a scientifically recognised mathematical-statistical procedure. We also verify with these aforementioned companies the address data provided by you.

6 DELIVERY
----------

Unless agreed otherwise, delivery will be made to the delivery address indicated by you. On our website you will find information on the availability of products sold by Amazon (e.g. on the respective product detail page). Please note that all information about the availability, shipping or delivery of a product is merely estimated information and contains approximate values and does not constitute binding or guaranteed shipping or delivery dates, unless expressly stated otherwise in the shipping options for the respective product. If we notice, while processing your order, that the products ordered by you are not available, we will inform you thereof in a separate e-mail or through our Message Center. Your statutory rights remain unaffected.

If we cannot deliver to you because the goods delivered do not fit through your entrance door, front door or your staircase, or you are not found at the delivery address given by you even though the delivery time has been announced to you with a reasonable period of notice you will have to bear the cost of such failed delivery.

7 CUSTOMS
---------

When ordering products from Amazon for delivery outside of the EU you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches the specified destination. Any additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges. Customs policies vary widely from country to country, so you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, please note that when ordering from Amazon, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the products. Your privacy is important to us and we would like our international customers to be aware that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities. For more information see [Customs, Duties, and Taxes](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=G2DJMEBWL3SACB6N).

8 1-CLICK ORDERING
------------------

1-Click ordering is the fastest and easiest way to order products safely and securely from Amazon. If you are using a public or shared computer terminal, we strongly recommend that you deactivate 1-Click ordering when you are not at the computer.

9 WARRANTY FOR PRODUCTS SOLD BY AMAZON AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to your 30-day returns guarantee, customers in the European Union have statutory warranty rights for a period of two years from the delivery of the goods and can request repair or replacement of the goods purchased at Amazon if these goods have defects or are not as described. If you are a consumer, you can still assert your rights within a further four months after the two years have expired. If the goods cannot be repaired or replaced within a reasonable time or without difficulties you can claim reimbursement or a reduction of the purchase price.

If a replacement is delivered to you as supplementary performance, you are obligated to return to us at our cost the goods initially delivered within 30 days. The return of the defective goods has to be made according to legal requirements. Amazon reserves the right to claim damages in accordance with statutory law.

In the case of used goods the warranty period can be shorter than two years.

For further information on the terms and conditions please see our return conditions.

Further information on your statutory warranty rights can be found on the following help page: [Warranty under Statutory Consumer Rights](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201310960).

Amazon is liable without limitation if damage is caused by an intentional or gross negligent breach of duty by Amazon or one of its legal representatives or vicarious agents.

In addition, Amazon is liable for slight negligent breach of essential obligations. Essential are those obligations the breach of which puts at risk the achievement of the contractual purpose, or the performance of which enables the fulfillment of the contract and is regularly trusted on by you. In this case, Amazon however is only liable for foreseeable damage typical of the contract. Amazon is not liable for slight negligent breach of any other obligations than those mentioned in the previous sentences.

The aforementioned limitations of liability do not apply for damages from injury to life, body or health, for a defect after a guarantee for the condition of the product or for fraudulently concealed defects. The liability under the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected.

To the extent the liability of Amazon is excluded or limited, such exclusion or limitation also applies to the employees, legal representatives or vicarious agents of Amazon.

10 SOFTWARE UPDATES
-------------------

For goods with digital elements, Amazon (or a relevant third party) will issue the following types of updates for digital products you purchase:

*   where applicable, updates which were specified on the product information page when you purchased the product; and (ii) updates which are required by law including to ensure the conformity of such good; see help page [Warranty under Statutory Consumer Rights](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201310960) .
*   Amazon (or a relevant third party) may also issue you with additional product updates from time to time including to: (i) offer or improve new functionality, designs, interfaces and/or features; (ii) to make minor technical changes; and/or (iii) for legal or security reasons, where considered reasonably necessary by Amazon (or a relevant third party). Some of these updates might not be necessary to ensure conformity of the product. By accepting the Conditions of Sale, you agree to be provided with such updates.
*   You agree that updates may be carried out automatically, without you needing to take any action. Where an update is not automatic, it will only take effect once installed by you. You acknowledge that if updates are not installed in a timely manner, or are not installed properly, this might impair the performance or functionalities of relevant products. Amazon will not be held liable for any lack of conformity resulting from your failure to install updates properly.

11 APPLICABLE LAW
-----------------

These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the District of Luxembourg City, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Conditions of Sale in Luxembourg or in the EU country in which you live. If you are a consumer and have your habitual residence in the EU, you additionally enjoy the protection afforded to you by mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence.
